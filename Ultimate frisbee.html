			<h2>About Ultimate</h2>
			<p>Ultimate, also and originally known as ultimate frisbee, is a non-contact team sport played with
				aflying disc (frisbee). Ultimate was developed in 1968 by a group of students at Columbia High School in
				Maplewood, New Jersey. Although Ultimate resembles many traditional sports in its athletic requirements,
				it is unlike most sports due to its focus on self-officiating, even at the highest levels of
				competition.

			<h2>Rules</h2>
			<p>A point is scored when one team catches the disc in the opposing team's end zone.
				Each point begins with both teams lining up on the front of their respective end zone line. Standing
				beyond the end zone line before the disc is thrown by the defense (a "pull") to the offense is known as
				an "offsides" violation. A regulation grass outdoor game has seven players per team. In mixed ultimate,
				usually it is 4-3, meaning either 4 men and 3 women at a time or 4 women and 3 men on the line. The
				offensive end zone dictates whether there are more men or women.
				Ultimate is non-contact which means non-incidental, play-affecting, or dangerous physical contact is not
				allowed. Defenders cannot take the disc from an offensive player who has secured a catch (this is known
				as a strip). Non-incidental contact is a foul, regardless of intent, with various consequences depending
				on the situation and the league rules. Incidental contact, like minor collisions while jumping for the
				disc or running for it can be acceptable, depending on the circumstances. Parameters like who has the
				"right" for the relevant space, who got the disc etc. will determine whether a foul has been committed
				or not. Attitudes can vary between leagues and countries, even if the letter of the rule remains the
				same.

				Contact is also disallowed for the defender marking the offense player with the disc, and there are
				further restrictions on positions this defender can take in order to minimise incidental contact.[33]

				Defending against the person who has the disc is a central part of the defensive strategy (colloquially
				"marking"). The defensive "marker" counts aloud to 10 seconds, which is referred to as "stalling". If
				the disc has not been thrown when the defending player reaches 10, it is turned over to the other team.
				"Stall" can be only be called after the defender has actually counted the 10 seconds.[34] There can only
				be one player defending in a 3-meter radius around the person who has the disc unless that player is
				defending against another offensive player. The marker must stay one disc's diameter away from the
				thrower and must not wrap their hands around the thrower, or the person with the disc can call a foul
				("wrapping").
